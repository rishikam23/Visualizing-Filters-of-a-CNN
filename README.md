# Visualizing Filters of a CNN using TensorFlow

## Overview
This repository documents my successful completion of the **"Visualizing Filters of a CNN using TensorFlow"** course on Coursera. The course provided a deep dive into how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) process and extract features from images, helping to visualize and interpret learned representations effectively.

## Course Objectives
The course focused on:
- Understanding CNN architectures and feature extraction mechanisms.
- Visualizing learned filters and activation maps in CNNs.
- Implementing gradient ascent to enhance and analyze filter activations.
- Using TensorFlow and Keras to build and interpret deep learning models.

## Key Learnings
Through this course, I gained expertise in:
- How different CNN layers detect edges, textures, and patterns.
- The hierarchical nature of feature learning in CNNs.
- Practical visualization techniques for convolutional layers.
- Implementing feature visualization using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python** – Scripting and deep learning implementation.
- **TensorFlow & Keras** – Model building, training, and visualization.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization of feature maps and filters.
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling and numerical computations.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive documentation and experimentation.

## Implementation Details
This repository includes implementations of:
1. **Basic CNN Model** – A simple convolutional model for image classification.
2. **Filter Visualization** – Using gradient ascent to highlight activated features.
3. **Activation Map Analysis** – Extracting and interpreting feature maps.

## Future Plans
Building on this knowledge, I aim to:
- Explore advanced model interpretability techniques.
- Apply CNN visualization methods to real-world AI applications.
- Work on explainable AI (XAI) to enhance model transparency.
- Implement visualization techniques in medical imaging and object detection.
